/* ============================================
 * SELECTOR EXPLANATION GUIDE
 * ============================================
 * 
 * Breaking down the complex selectors:
 * 
 * .dragAndDropList:has(.drop-target-hovered)
 * └── Only when the drag list contains an element being dragged over
 * 
 * > .draggable-item
 * └── Direct child draggable items of the drag list
 * 
 * :has(~ .is-dragging)
 * └── Items that have a dragging sibling element after them in the DOM
 * 
 * :not(:has(~ .drop-target-hovered))
 * └── Exclude items that have a dragged-over sibling after them
 * 
 * :not(.drop-target-hovered-bottom)
 * └── Exclude items where the user is dragging over the bottom half
 * 
 * .is-dragging ~ .draggable-item
 * └── Items that come after the dragging element in the DOM
 * 
 * :has(~ .drop-target-hovered)
 * └── Items that have a dragged-over sibling after them
 * 
 * This creates the visual effect where elements "make room" for the 
 * dragging element by sliding up or down based on drag direction.
